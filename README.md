A simple Asteroids game created in C# GUI for beginner

To learn program I started working on something simple. So I built Asteroids one of my favourite childhood game using C# GUI. As time went on I started adding to it and I m very happy with the outcome there are a lot of advanced level of programming skills being used which I gained from my college. After 5 years I have found this game just laying in my hard drive. There are a lot of bugs and some of the lines are legacy codes.
