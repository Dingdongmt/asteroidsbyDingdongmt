A simple Asteroids game created in C# GUI for beginner

To learn program I started working on something simple. So I built Asteroids one of my favourite childhood game using C# GUI. As time went on I started adding to it and I m very happy with the outcome there are a lot of advanced level of programming skills being used which I gained from my college. After 5 years I have found this game just laying in my hard drive. There are a lot of bugs and some of the lines are legacy codes.

Pleas do not use this as a tool to learn programming or anything else. Most of the Codes syntex are lagecy and there are far better code with up to date and with far less bugs. But if you wish to get it as a fun plaything to improve it or waste time feel free. lol :)
